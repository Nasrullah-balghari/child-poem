                ONCE UPON A TIME a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters. Poor Cinderella
                had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when
                it was still dark and cold to start the fire.
                It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean,
                from all the ashes and cinders by the fire. Cinderella Story Thank you, Artist Carla Oly “What a mess!”
                her two stepsisters laughed.
                And that is why they called her “Cinderella.” One day, big news came to town. The King and Queen were
                going to have a ball! It was time for the Prince to find a bride. All of the young ladies in the land
                were invited to come. They were
                wild with joy! They would wear their most beautiful gown and fix their hair extra nice. Maybe the prince
                would like them! At Cinderella’s house, she now had extra work to do. She had to make two brand-new
                gowns for her step-sisters. “Faster!”
                shouted one step-sister. “You call that a dress?” screamed the other. “Oh, dear!” said Cinderella. “When
                can I–“ The stepmother marched into the room. “When can you WHAT?” “Well,” said the girl, “when will I
                have time to make my own dress
                for the ball?” “You?” yelled the stepmother. “Who said YOU were going to the ball?” “What a laugh!” said
                one step-sister. “Such a mess!” They pointed at Cinderella. All of them laughed. Cinderella said to
                herself, “When they look at me,
                maybe they see a mess. But I am not that way. And if I could, I WOULD go to the ball.” Soon the time
                came for the stepmother and step-sisters to leave for the big party. Cinderella Story Thank you, Artist
                Carla Oly Their fine carriage
                came to the door. The stepmother and step-sisters hopped inside. And they were off. “Good-bye!” called
                Cinderella. “Have a good time!” But her stepmother and step-sisters did not turn around to see her. “Ah,
                me!” said Cinderella sadly.
                The carriage rode down the street. She said aloud, “I wish I could go to the ball, too!” Then - Poof!
                All of a sudden, in front of her was a fairy. “You called?” said the fairy. “Did I?” said Cinderella.
                “Who are you?” “Why, your Fairy
                Godmother, of course! I know your wish. And I have come to grant it.” “But…” said Cinderella, “my wish
                is impossible.” “Excuse me!” said the Fairy Godmother in a huff. “Did I not just show up out of thin
                air?” “Yes, you did,” said Cinderella.
                “Then let me be the one to say what is possible or not!” “Well, I think you know I want to go to the
                ball, too.” She looked down at her dirty clothes. “But look at me.” “You do look a bit of a mess,
                child,” said the Fairy Godmother. “Even
                if I had something nice to wear," said the girl, "I would have no way to get there." “Dear me, all of
                that is possible,” said the Fairy. With that, she tapped her wand on Cinderella’s head. Cinderella Story
                Thank you, Artist Carla Oly
                At once, Cinderella was all clean. She was dressed in a beautiful blue gown. Her hair was set up high on
                her head inside a golden band. “This is wonderful!” said Cinderella. “Who said I was done?” said the
                Fairy Godmother. She tapped her
                wand again. At once, a beautiful carriage came to be, with a driver and four white horses. Cinderella
                Story Thank you, Artist Carla Oly “Am I dreaming?” said Cinderella, looking around her. “It is as real,
                as real can be,” said the Fairy
                Godmother. “But there is one thing you must know.” “What is that?” “All of this lasts only to midnight.
                Tonight, at the stroke of midnight, it will all be over. Everything will go back to how it was before.”
                “Then I must be sure to leave
                the ball before midnight!” said Cinderella. “Good idea,” said the Fairy Godmother. She stepped back. “My
                work is done.” And with that, the Fairy Godmother was gone. Cinderella looked around her. "Did that even
                happen?" But there she stood
                in a fine gown, and with a golden band in her hair. And there were her driver and four horses before
                her, waiting. “Coming?” called the driver. She stepped into the carriage. And they were off. Cinderella
                Story Thank you, Artist Carla
                Oly Over at the ball, the Prince did not know what to think. “Why do you have that sad look on your
                face?” the Queen said to her son. “Look around you! You could not ask for finer maidens than these.” “I
                know, Mother,” said the Prince.
                Yet he knew something was wrong. He had met many of the young women. Yet after he said “hello,” one by
                one, he could find nothing more to say. "Look!" Someone pointed to the front door. “Who is that?” All
                heads turned. Who was that lovely
                maiden stepping down the stairs? She held her head tall and looked as if she belonged. But no one knew
                her. “There is something about her,” said the Prince to himself. “I will ask her to dance.” And he
                walked over to Cinderella. “Have
                we met?” said the Prince. “I am pleased to meet you now,” said Cinderella with a bow. “I feel as if I
                know you,” said the Prince. “But of course, that is impossible.” “Many things are possible,” said
                Cinderella, “if you wish them to be
                true.” The Prince felt a leap in his heart. He and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, they
                danced again. And then they danced again, and yet again. Soon the other maidens at the ball grew
                jealous. “Why is he dancing all the time
                with her?” they said. “How rude!” But all the Prince could see was Cinderella. They laughed and talked,
                and they danced some more. In fact, they danced for so long that Cinderella did not see the clock.
                “Dong!” said the clock. Cinderella
                looked up. Cinderella Story Thank you, Artist Carla Oly “Dong!” went the clock again. She looked up
                again. “Oh, my!” she cried out. “It is almost midnight!” “Dong!” rung the clock. “Why does that matter?”
                said the Prince. “Dong!” called
                the clock. “I must go!” said Cinderella. “Dong!” went the clock. “But we just met!” said the Prince.
                “Why leave now?” “Dong!” rung the clock. “I must GO!” said Cinderella. She ran to the steps. Cinderella
                Story Thank you, Artist Carla
                Oly “Dong!” said the clock. “I cannot hear you,” said the Prince. “The clock is too loud!” “Dong!” rung
                the clock. “Goodbye!” said Cinderella. Up, up the stairs she ran. “Dong!” went the clock. “Please, stop
                for a moment!” said the Prince.
                “Oh, dear!” she said as one glass slipper fell off her foot on the stair. But Cinderella kept running
                up. Cinderella Story Thank you, Artist Carla Oly “Dong!” said the clock. “Please wait a moment!” said
                the Prince. “Dong!” rung the clock.
                “Goodbye!” Cinderella turned one last time. Then she rushed out the door. “Dong!” The clock was quiet.
                It was midnight. “Wait!” called the Prince. He picked up her glass slipper and rushed out the door. He
                looked around but could not see
                her blue dress anywhere. “This is all I have left from her,” he said, looking down at the glass slipper.
                He saw that it was made in a special way, to fit a foot like none other. “Somewhere there is the other
                glass slipper,” he said. “And
                when I find it, I will find her, too. Then I will ask her to be my bride!” From hut to hut, from house
                to house, went the Prince. One young woman after another tried to fit her foot inside the glass slipper.
                But none could fit. And so
                the Prince moved on. At last the Prince came to Cinderella’s house. “He is coming!” called one
                step-sister as she looked out the window. “At the door!” screamed the other step-sister. “Quick!” yelled
                the stepmother. “Get ready! One of
                you must be the one to fit your foot in that slipper. No matter what!” The Prince knocked. The
                stepmother flew open the door. “Come in!” she said. “I have two lovely daughters for you to see.” The
                first step-sister tried to place her foot
                in the glass slipper. She tried hard, but it just would not fit. Then the second step-sister tried to
                fit her foot inside. She tried and tried with all her might, too. But no dice. “Are there no other young
                women in the house?” said the
                Prince. “None,” said the stepmother. “Then I must go,” said the Prince. “Maybe there is one more,” said
                Cinderella, stepping into the room. “I thought you said there were no other young women here,” said the
                Prince. “None who matter!”
                said the stepmother in a hiss. “Come here,” said the Prince. Cinderella Story Thank you, Artist Carla
                Oly Cinderella stepped up to him. The Prince got down on one knee and tried the glass slipper on her
                foot. It fit perfectly! Then, from
                her pocket Cinderella took out something. It was the other glass slipper! “I knew it!” he cried. “You
                are the one!” “WHAT?” shouted a step-sister. “Not HER!” screamed the other step-sister. “This cannot
                BE!” yelled the stepmother. But
                it was too late. The prince knew that Cinderella was the one. He looked into her eyes. He did not see
                the cinders in her hair or the ashes on her face. “I have found you!” he said. “And I have found you,”
                said Cinderella. And so Cinderella
                and the Prince were married, and they lived happily ever after.

            <p>
                Once upon a time, a princess named Snow White lived in a castle with her father, the King, and her
                stepmother, the Queen. Her father had always said to his daughter that she must be fair to everyone at
                court. Said he, “People come here to the castle when
                they have a problem. They need the ruler to make a fair decision. Nothing is more important than to be
                fair.” The Queen, Snow White’s stepmother, knew how much this meant to her husband. At the first chance,
                she went to her magic mirror.
                “Mirror, mirror, on the wall,” said the Queen. “Who is the fairest of them all?” Snow White and the
                Seven Dwarfs “Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror. “What?!” yelled the Queen.
                “No one is more fair than I! The
                Queen must have the best of everything - everyone knows that. What could be more fair than that?” “Snow
                White is the fairest of them all!” repeated the Magic Mirror. “What do you know – you’re a mirror!”
                roared the Queen. And she stormed
                off. Still, the Queen was bothered. So bothered was she that the Queen decided to be rid of the girl,
                once and for all. “I cannot wait another day!” she declared. The Queen called for her servant, a
                huntsman. “Find a reason to take Snow
                White deep into the woods,” she said, pointing her long finger at the servant. “Then kill her.” The
                huntsman was shocked! But she was the Queen and what could he do? The next day he took Snow White into
                the woods. As he drew his knife
                to slay her, Snow White turned around. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs “Look,” she said, taking
                something out of her pocket. “You have always been good to me.” She held in front of him six perfect
                arrowheads that she had carefully shaped.
                “Do you like them?” she said. “They are for you.” “Snow White,” said the huntsman. “I cannot do this!”
                “You can take these,” said Snow White. "That's not what I mean," said the servant. He dropped to his
                knees. “How can I say this to you?
                The Queen, your step-mother, ordered me to kill you,” he said. “But I cannot!” “She did what?” Snow
                White called out with alarm. “You must run away!” said the huntsman. “Far into the woods. Now! And never
                come back to the castle!” Snow
                White turned and ran into the woods as fast as she could. Deeper and deeper she ran. It was getting
                dark, and the wolves were starting to howl. She tripped and her skirt was torn. Tall tree branches
                seemed to reach down to the very ground
                to grab her. She was scratched, bleeding and scared. Yet she ran on and on. Then all of a sudden, far
                away, there was a light. Who was living so deep in the woods? She stepped up closer. It was a cottage!
                Yet no sound came from the cottage,
                only light from the windows. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs “Hello?” she said, knocking softly on the
                door. “Hello?” No answer. The door was a little bit open. She opened it some more and stepped in.
                “Hello, is anyone home?” She looked
                around. What a mess! She had never seen a messier living room. “This cottage may be the biggest mess I
                ever saw,” she thought. “But it's a roof over my head for tonight. Maybe if I clean up around here, I
                can earn my sleep.” As she cleaned,
                she thought of someone she already missed. Before her father had re-married, she and a Prince who lived
                in the next kingdom were getting to know each other. They would take long walks in the royal garden and
                tell each other stories, and
                laugh. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs After the Queen had moved into the castle, her stepmother had
                made a new rule – no more visitors. Now the Prince had to slip over the palace gate in secret. He would
                call out to her from under her
                window and they could talk a bit that way. It wasn’t as good as the long walks but it was the best they
                could manage. Now that she had to run away from home, would she ever see him again? After Snow White
                cleaned up the living room, she
                went upstairs. On the second floor, there were seven little beds lined up in a row, as if for children.
                Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned and lay across all seven of the beds. Soon she fell fast asleep.
                In the meantime, the Seven
                Dwarfs were heading home from a long day of working in the jewel mines. When they opened the door, you
                can imagine their surprise when they saw their cottage all cleaned up! “What kind of magic is this?”
                said one of the Dwarfs, whose name
                was Doc. “I wouldn’t mind more magic like this!” said another of the Dwarfs with a smile. His name was
                Dopey. “We'd better check upstairs,” said another Dwarf, whose name was Grumpy. “Something is fishy
                around here, that’s for sure.” There
                – lying across all their beds, was a young lady, fast asleep. “Who are you?” said all the Dwarfs at
                once. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Snow White bolted awake. The Seven Dwarfs could tell she was as
                surprised as they were. Soon they
                all relaxed and shared their stories. Snow White learned their names – Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy,
                Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy. She told them all about her step-mother. That her stepmother had tried to get
                the huntsman to kill her, that
                the huntsman had set her free in the woods, and that she could never go back home again. “Stay here,
                with us,” said Bashful. “That’s sweet,” said Snow White. “But if I were to stay here at your home, I
                would have to do something for all
                of you.” “You already cleaned up our place,” said Sneezy. “Keeping the house clean will be easy,” said
                Snow White, “as long as we all pitch in. I will let everyone know what part they can do, and I will do
                my share too, of course.” “That’s
                fair,” said Happy. “But there must be something else I can do for you,” said Snow White. The Seven
                Dwarfs shrugged. “Do you know how to read?” said Doc. "We have these books filled with wonderful tales
                and would love to be able to read
                them." And so it was agreed that Snow White would give them reading lessons. Snow White and the Seven
                Dwarfs To celebrate their new friendship, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs sang and danced the night
                away. The next morning before they
                left for work, the Seven Dwarfs warned Snow White she must not open the door to anyone. After all, who
                knows what evil her stepmother might do? The princess nodded in agreement, and the Dwarfs left the
                house. The princess prepared her
                first reading lesson. She also prepared a good hot meal for the Seven Dwarfs when they returned home
                that night. And so the days passed. Back at the castle, the Queen marched up to her mirror. “Mirror,
                mirror on the wall," she demanded.
                "Who is the fairest of them all?” “Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror. Snow
                White and the Seven Dwarfs “That’s impossible!” screamed the Queen. “The girl is no longer alive!” “Snow
                White lives!” said the Magic
                Mirror. And an image was shown on the mirror of Snow White living in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.
                The Queen turned red with rage. She screamed, “She will not get away with this!” At the cottage of the
                Dwarfs the next afternoon, when
                the Seven Dwarfs were away at work, there was a knock on the door. “Who is it?” said Snow White. She
                remembered the warning of the Seven Dwarfs not to open the door to anyone. “It’s only a poor old woman,”
                came a squeaky voice, “selling
                apples.” Yet it was the evil Queen, disguised as an old woman. “It’s raining out here, my dear,” said
                her voice through the door. “Please let me in.” “Poor thing," thought Snow White, "having to go door to
                door selling apples in the rain."
                And so she opened the door. “Take a look at this big red apple,” said the old woman, who as you know by
                now was really the Queen in disguise. She held the red apple close to Snow White’s face. “Lovely, my
                dear, isn’t it?” Snow White and
                the Seven Dwarfs “I would like very much to buy your apple,” said Snow White. “But I have no money.”
                “That fine comb in your hair will make a good trade,” said the old woman. “Well, all right then!” said
                Snow White. She took the comb out
                of her hair and gave it to the old woman, who then gave her the apple. Snow White took a big bite. Alas,
                the fruit was poisoned! At once, Snow White fell to the ground in a deep sleep. “YES!” shouted the
                Queen, pumping the air with her
                fists. Just then the door flew open. In marched the Seven Dwarfs, home from the day's work. Shocked
                indeed they were to find Snow White lying on the floor and what must be her stepmother beside her,
                laughing! They chased that evil Queen
                out the door, and into the storm. Up to the very top of a mountain they chased her. All of a sudden,
                lightning hit the mountain! The Queen fell, and she was never seen again. But there was nothing to help
                poor Snow White. She stayed absolutely
                still in her deep sleep. The Seven Dwarfs gently lifted her into a glass coffin. Day and night they kept
                watch over her. One day, the Prince happened to pass through. Ever since he had learned that Snow White
                was missing at the castle,
                he was searching for her, far and wide. Now he had finally found her, but in such a state! The Prince
                pulled open the glass coffin. Her face seemed so fresh, even in that deep sleep. Snow White and the
                Seven Dwarfs He gently took one of
                Snow White's hands in his own and kissed it. At once, Snow White’s eyes opened! With Love's First Kiss,
                the evil Queen's spell was forever gone. Now nothing stood in the way for Snow White and the Prince to
                be together forever. They returned
                to the kingdom and lived happily ever after.

                Many years ago, China was in the middle of a great war. The Emperor said that one man from each Chinese
                family must leave his family to join the army. Mulan, a teenage girl who lived in a faraway village of
                China, heard the news when she was outside washing
                clothes. Thanks to Artist, Bella, 8, FL USA Mulan ran into the house. Her father was sitting in a chair,
                carving a piece of wood. “Father!" she said. "Did you hear what the Emperor says each family must do?”
                “Yes," said her old father,
                “I heard about it in town. Well, I may as well go pack up.” He put down his carving, stood up and walked
                very slowly to his room. “Wait!” said Mulan, “Father, you have not been well. If I may say so, why at
                your age must you keep up with
                all those young men?” Thanks to Artist, Zach, 13, CO USA “What else can be done?” said her father. “Your
                brother is a child. He cannot go.” “Of course that's true,” said Mulan. “He is too little. But I have an
                idea." She poured her father
                a cup of tea and handed it to him. "Father, have some tea. Please sit a minute. I will be right back.”
                "Very well, dear," said the father. Thanks to Artist, Lea, 10, Ontario Canada Mulan went into her room.
                With her sword, she cut off
                her long, black hair. She put on her father’s robe. Going back to her father, Mulan said, “Look at me. I
                am your son now. I will go in your place. I will do my part for China.” “No, my daughter!” said the old
                man. “You cannot do this!”
                Thanks to Artist, Alara, Turkey “Father, listen please," said Mulan. “For years, you trained me in Kung
                Fu. You showed me how to use a sword.” Mulan swung the sword back and forth with might. “Only so that
                you could stay safe!” said her
                father. “I never meant for you to go to war. If they find out you are a woman, you know as well as I do
                that you will die!” “No one will find out, Father,” said Mulan. She picked up her sword. "Mulan!" said
                the Father. He tried to get
                up but had to hold on to his chair. The daughter kissed him goodbye. "I love you, Father," she said.
                "Take care of yourself. Tell my brother I said goodbye." She climbed on a family horse. And off she went
                to join the Emperor’s army. Thanks
                to Artist, Katelyn,13, CO USA In the army, Mulan proved to be a brave soldier. In time, she was put in
                charge of other soldiers. Her battles went so well that she was put in charge of more soldiers. Her
                battles kept on going well. After
                a few years Mulan was given the top job - she would be General of the entire army. Not long after that,
                a very bad fever swept through the army. Many soldiers were sick. And Mulan became sick, too, the
                General of the army. When the doctor
                came out of Mulan's tent, he knew the truth. “The General is a woman?” yelled the soldiers. “How can
                this be?” Some called out, “She tricked us!” and “We will not fight for a woman!” They said, “Punish
                her! Make her pay! The cost is for
                her to die!” Thanks to Artist, Nehemiah, 13, CO USA But others called out, in voices just as loud, “With
                Mulan, we win every battle!” They said, “Stay away from our General!” Just then, a soldier ran up.
                “Everyone!" he called. "A surprise
                attack is coming!” Mulan heard this from inside her tent. She got dressed and went outside. She was not
                yet strong, but stood tall. She told the soldiers where they must go to hide so they could attack when
                the enemy came. But they must
                get there fast! The soldiers, even those who did not like that their General was a woman, could tell
                that Mulan knew what she was talking about. Thanks to Anonymous Artist It worked! The battle was won. It
                was such a big victory that the
                enemy gave up, at last. The war was over, and China was saved! You can be sure that after that last
                battle, no one cared anymore that Mulan was a woman. The Emperor was so glad that Mulan had ended the
                long war, he set aside the rule about
                being a woman. “Mulan, stay with me in the palace,” he said. “Someone as smart as you would be a fine
                royal adviser.” Mulan bowed deeply. “You are too kind, Sire,” she said. “But if you please. What I wish
                most of all is to return home
                to my family.” “Then at least take these fine gifts,” said the Emperor. "So everyone at your home
                village will know how much the Emperor of China thinks of you." Mulan returned to her village with six
                fine horses and six fine swords. Everyone
                cheered that she was safe. The person who had saved China was their very own Mulan!
